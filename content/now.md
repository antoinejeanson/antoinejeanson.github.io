# Designing a rocket engine

I'm currently a part of the Eve project, aiming to design an open-source liquid fuel rocket engine.
The project is part of a much bigger initiative called Federation Open Space Makers.

# Film photography

I've picked up film photography and I'm having a blast with it.
I shoot mainly on a Nikon FG-20 (35mm) and a Royflex 1 Bis (6x6 medium format).
I post some of them on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/antoinejeanson/).
I'm currently looking into developing my own films at home.
