I recently started contributing to a project that I think you may find interesting.

Eve is a project under the [Fédération - Open Space Makers](https://www.federation-openspacemakers.com/en/) umbrella whose goal is to design, build and test open-source
liquid-fueled rocket engines.

The project has been dormant for a while, but we are now trying to revive it.
As of today, the project is still in its early stages, but some progress has already been made.

A previous group of contributors designed the combustion chamber and propellant injector for a 1-kN Methalox engine.
We are now working on the design of a smaller, 0.1-kN sized liquid-fueled engine as a first step towards larger engines.

You can check out the project's [Github org](https://github.com/FOSM-Eve).

You can also check out the project's [showcase](https://www.federation-openspacemakers.com/en/participate/projects/eve/) on the Fédération Open Space Makers website. As of now, the showcase is not up to date, but we are working on it.
